### Hi there, my name is Pamela Gutierrez 👋

I'm a web developer interested in blending clean and efficient code with thoughtful and aesthetic frontend design. I'm a gradutate of the UC Berkeley Full-Stack Development Bootcamp where I was able to grow my skills in both frontend and backend development. I've worked on a variety of a solo and collaborative projects using Javascript, jQuery, React, Node, Express, Handlebars are more. In addition to my technical skills I'm very much a people-oriented person and enjoy working in teams as well as in presentational and client oriented roles. I'm eager to keep learning, adding to my reportoire, and contributing to meaningful projects.

⚡&emsp;Fun fact: 
<br>
I've lived in a bunch of "random" and beautiful places ranging from the Guatamalan jungle to inner-city Madrid to the Australian Outback. I love new challenges, be it cultural, creative or technical, and was inspired to become a coder by a childhood interest in carpentry because I love the idea of seeing the tangible progress after a hard day's work. But I wasn't great with hammers and tablesaws are pretty scary so I thought I'd try my hand at a different kind of building and I'm so glad I did!
