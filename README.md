### Hi there, I'm Pamela Gutierrez 👋

I'm a web developer interested in blending clean and efficient code with thoughtful and aesthetic frontend design. I'm a graduate of the UC Berkeley Full-Stack Development Bootcamp where I was able to grow my skills in both frontend and backend development. I've worked on a variety of a solo and collaborative projects using Javascript, jQuery, React, Node, Express, Handlebars are more. In addition to my technical skills I'm very much a people-oriented person and enjoy working in teams as well as in presentational and client oriented roles. I'm eager to keep learning, adding to my reportoire, and contributing to meaningful projects.

An e-commerce website for San Francisco-based baker Danielle M. Estrella. Check out the project in my pinned respositories!

🗺️&emsp;Fun fact: 
<br>
I've lived in a bunch of "random" and beautiful places ranging from the Guatamalan jungle to inner-city Madrid to the Australian Outback. I love new challenges, be it cultural, creative or technical, and was inspired to become a coder by a childhood interest in carpentry. I know, it's a bit of a strange connection, but I've always loved the idea of seeing tangible progress after a hard day's work. Reality eventually struck, I wasn't great with hammers and tablesaws are pretty scary, so I thought I'd try my hand at a different kind of building and I'm so glad I did. I may use different tools these days but the satisfaction at the end of the day is one and the same!
